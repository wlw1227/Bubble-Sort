# Bubble Sort
Iterates through an array, sorting pairs of numbers sequencially until all numbers are in order.

Takes an array of numbers as a parameter and uses the length of the array to determine how many iterations to run. It takes the length minus one to ensure all numbers are placed in sequential order. Once done, it returns the array.
